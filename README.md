## In-The-Money

This program:
* Reads a text file representing an online poker tournament hand 
* Calculates every player's equity of the total prize-pool
* Displays the likelihood that each player will finish 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
* Shows the probability that each player will make it in the money


Program Assumptions:
* The tournament is a 9 player tournament with the payouts being 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place


Note: In the example hh.txt given, notice that the player with the most chips has more than double 2nd place's chips, but has less than double the equity. This is a critical element of tournament poker.
